1. For initial setup downsample or upsample each class so that the non BENIGN classes have 8000 entries. Downsample the BENIGN class to have 40000 entries. 
2. Break up resulting test set (in dataframe) into train, validation, test set. Test is 15% of the total data, validation is 15% of the remaining and the rest is training data
3. Logistic regression produces an accuracy of 0.9336 and F1 score of 0.9338 on the validation set

1. The CICIDS 2017 data is from:  https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html
2. The CICIDS 2017 paper (published in 2018) is described in "Toward Generating a New Intrusion Detection Dataset and Intrusion Traffic Characterization"
   This paper is available https://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2018/66398/66398.pdf
3. U+FFDD (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specials_(Unicode_block)) in Thursday-WorkingHours-Morning-WebAttacks.pcap_ISCX.csv. Likely file will need to be cleaned to remove this character.
4. Fields 'Flow Bytes/s' : 'X15', ' Flow Packets/s' : 'X16' seem to have nans, infinity in them. These columns are candidates for dropping from the data set. The CICIDS2017 paper does not use these two fields for anything.
5. The CICIDS2017 paper combines the three different types of "Web Attack" into one class in its summary.
